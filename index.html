                <h2>THE MISSILE MAN OF INDIA</h2>
                <br><br>
                <p><b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> (15 October 1931 â€“ 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and 
                    statesman 
                    who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. Born and raised in a Muslim family
                     in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a
                      scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)
                       and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme
                        and military missile development efforts.[2] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his
                         work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.[3][4][5] He also played a 
                         pivotal organisational, technical, and political role 
                    in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
